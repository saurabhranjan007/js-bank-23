    const greet = (name) => {
        console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
    }
    btnClose.addEventListner('click', greet('Sam')) 
        // here in this example "addEventListner()" will be considered as a higher oder functions 'coz it receives "greet()" func as an input. 
        // and "greet()" here will be called as a callback function 'coz "addEventListner()" func will call the "greet()" func later. 

    >> 2. Function returning another function

        let counter = 0; 

        return returnCounter() {
